<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What's a CTF

A CTF or Capture The Flag, is a game like environment in which you have a series of challenges,<br />
think of them like small exercices you must solve in order to find a "flag".<br />

For this CTF a flag will look something like this : 

**Flag number X :**
  ```sh
    1fxfDQbW8LJ97VHcYxDmHREdDQLQZAOo
  ```
  
It's a 32 characters long string that is unique to each challenge.<br />
You must find the flag for challenge 1 to get to challenge 2.
 
 <!-- Prerequisites -->
## Prerequisites

We will need the command SSH (Secure Shell) to access the challenges :

  ```sh
    ssh <USERNEAME>@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
  ```
Replace `USERNAME` with `bandit0` for the first challenge and `bandit<Number>` for all subsequent challenges.

This can be done in one of 3 ways :

### Using one of the Linux labs as a plateform

Open the Lab number [41 Lab - Bash Shell Scripts](https://awsrestart.instructure.com/courses/965/modules/items/448683)

Reminder : This lab has a timer limit of 25 min

### Using the application Putty on windows

1. Download PuTTY to SSH into the CTF : [Download link](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe)

2. Launch putty.exe

3. Configure PuTTY timeout to keep the PuTTY session open for a longer period of time:

    Click Connection.
    Set Seconds between keepalives to 30

  ```
