 <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What's a CTF

A CTF or Capture The Flag, is a game like environment in which you have a series of challenges (think of them like small exercices)
you must solve in order to find a "flag"

For this CTF a flag will look something like this : 

*Flag number 0 :
  ```sh
    1fxfDQbW8LJ97VHcYxDmHREdDQLQZAOo
  ```
  
 it's a 32 characters long string that is unique to each challenge.
 You must find the flag for challenge 1 to get to challenge 2.
 
 <!-- Prerequisites -->
## Prerequisites

We will need the command SSH (Secure Shell) to access the challenges :

  ```sh
    ssh <USERNEAME>@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
  ```
Replace <USERNAME> with bandit0 for the first challenge and bandit<Number> for all subsequent challenges
this can be done in one of 3 ways

### Using one of the Linux labs as a plateform

Open the Lab number (41-[LX]-Lab - Bash Shell Scripts)[https://awsrestart.instructure.com/courses/965/modules/items/448683]
